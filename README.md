# Shaping Up with Angular.js

The working Gem Store example from Code School's Shaping Up with Angular.js course.

# Getting Up and Running

You will need Node.js to create an http-server. Once you have downloaded Node.js type the following in the CMD line.  

```
npm install http-server -g
```

This will install the http-server which can then be run using the following command

```
http-server
```

Make sure you run this from your directory where the index.html resides.
